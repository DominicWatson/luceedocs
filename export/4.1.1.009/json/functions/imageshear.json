Image quality is lower than the other interpolation methods, but processing is fastest.\n- bilinear: Applies the bilinear method of interpolation. The quality of the image is less pixelated than the default, but processing is slower.\n- bicubic: Applies the bicubic method of interpolation. Generally, the quality of image is highest with this method and processing is slowest."}],"argMin":2,"returnType":"void","status":"implemeted","name":"imageshear","type":"java","argumentType":"fixed","description":"Shears an image either horizontally or vertically."}
