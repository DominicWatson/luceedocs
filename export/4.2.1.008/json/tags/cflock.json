An exclusive lock single-threads access to the CFML constructs in its body. Single-threaded access\n  implies that the body of the tag can be executed by at most one request at a time. A request executing\n  inside a cflock tag has an \"exclusive lock\" on the tag. No other requests can start executing inside the\n  tag while a request has an exclusive lock. Railo issues exclusive locks on a first-come, first-served\n  basis. A read-only lock allows multiple requests to access the CFML constructs inside its body concurrently.\n  Therefore, read-only locks should be used only when the shared data is read only and not modified. If another\n  request already has an exclusive lock on the shared data, the request waits for the exclusive lock to be\n  released.","nameSpace":"cf"}
